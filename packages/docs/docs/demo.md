# Online Demo

Here is the URL:

## Automatic Admin Privilege

On the demo site, when you change your user name to something other than "new user" on the profile page, you are automatically granted the administrator (God) privilege. This means that everyone is able to view all logs, delete them, enter God mode, and freely control other players.

However, to maintain minimum functionality, even administrators are not allowed to do the following. Attempts to do so will result in a 401 API error.

- You cannot change the profile of other players, including their user name.
- You cannot add new NPC accounts.
- You cannot delete game logs created before July 2023.

## Terms of Use for the Demo Site

Before accessing the demo site, please agree to the following:

- If you sign up for the demo site, we will have access to your Gmail account name or email address. We will not use this information for any purpose.
- The demo site should only be used to evaluate the functionality of our project. [Set up your own site](./install) for actual AI development or storing large amounts of data.
- The user name and the game logs you create on the demo site will be visible to other users. Do not post any personal information (such as your real name) or inappropriate remarks.
- Since everyone will have the admin privilege, other users may (accidentally or intentionally) abort your game or use God mode to play games pretending you.
- Your game logs may be deleted without notice.
