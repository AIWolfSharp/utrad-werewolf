# Welcome to UTRAD Werewolf Documentation

**UTRAD Werewolf** is an open source web UI for the Werewolf game (the _Jinr≈ç_ game).

<Figure src="screenshot-god" caption="Example Game UI (God Mode View)" />

This app allows you to:

- **Play Werewolf online between humans based on the AIWolf regulation**: Such data can be used for AI training, especially for fine-tuning a large language model.
- **Play Werewolf between humans and AI**: You can [create AI-driven bot accounts](./bot), and make them play Werewolf with human players. (You need to develop an AI algorithm by yourself.)
- **Play an AI-to-AI Werewolf game**: This could be useful for AI reinforcement learning. Use this app as a game viewer.

This project was created to support natural language Werewolf research based on the AIWolf regulation.
