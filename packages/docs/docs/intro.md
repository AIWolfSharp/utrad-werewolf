# Welcome to UTRAD Werewolf Documentation

**UTRAD Werewolf** is an open source web UI for the Werewolf game (the _jinr≈ç_ game). This app enables you to:

- **Play Werewolf between humans based on the Aiwolf regulation**: Such data can be used for training AI, especially for fine-tuning a large language model.
- **Play Wewewolf between humans and AI**: You can create AI-driven bot accounts, and make them play Werewolf with human players. (You need to develop an AI algorithm by yourself.)
- **Play an AI-to-AI wargame**.

It has a web UI for playing Werewolf between 5 or more human players based on the AIWolf rules. The resulting log data can be used to train AI agents.
